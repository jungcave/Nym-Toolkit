# Nym Toolkit

## EN

Nym Toolkit is collection of tools for 3d-artists that adds varios essential functions to Blender.

Nym Toolkit consists of my assetpack (with brushes, node groups, etc), Nym Keyconfig and SugarKit addon. It also contains some operators based on free open sourced ones - they are dedicated for personal use and all links to original sources are present in TrdPartyBased.py.
